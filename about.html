				Hello, my name is Mirelis. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. Since I was a kid I was fascinated with the idea of traveling the world, learning new cultures and languages. I imagined myself living in a different country; going to school in that country, with different kids and a different language. I imagine myself in a new country every year. I wanted to learn every language I could think of. Luckily for me, my parents liked to travel so I started traveling to South America, the US and Canada when I was a kid. Since then I knew I wanted to be a Flight attendant. I went to college to follow my dad steps of becoming an engineer, but that dream fell through because deep inside I wanted to travel the world.  </p>

                    Finally I turn 20 and after two years of jumping into different majors in college, I moved to the US, didn't know anyone but this young lady, friend of my aunt decided to help me. After four months I was finally in training for Flight Attendant. I traveled the US, Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean for seven years, for a regional airline that serves Delta Airlines and used to serve Northwest Air link. On my days off I will fly to Europe or to visit my family in Puerto Rico. I recently took another position at Delta Air lines and left the regional, I am also in school for Computer Science. I recently visited Rome, Italy and I hope to keep traveling until I can no longer fly.
